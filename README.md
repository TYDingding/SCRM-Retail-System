This project aims to implement unmanned supermarkets and precision marketing. 

1. Users use WeChat mini-programs to complete independent purchases of goods, and administrators analyze and push data accurately. 
2. Users use face scanning to register and log in, use cameras to scan product barcodes, generate payment information, and pay with face recognition. 
3. The administrator scans the barcode of the product to enter the product information into the database, and implement precise marketing based on the user's information and purchase records.
